# Wellington E-Sports Page - (In Development)

> Me and my mate had an idea to create an E-Sports website that acts like a hub for E-Sports in Wellington. It will allow people to register for competitions and sign up to events held in Wellington.

> Our goal is to try to grow E-Sports in Wellington and create an easier way for people get involved in the E-Sports scene through the website we are currently developing.
